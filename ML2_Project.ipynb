        "## Project Goal / Motivation\n",
        "The goal of this project is to create new potential YuGiOh! cards. Specifically, the goal is to create new YuGiOh! Card names, card descriptions and even an image for the card itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "The motivation behind this project is to explore the potential of machine learning and natural language processing in generating creative content. By creating a card generator, you can demonstrate the ability to capture patterns and generate novel outputs based on existing data. This project can also serve as a creative tool for game developers, enthusiasts, or even as a source of inspiration for designing new cards in the YuGiOh! game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Relevance\n",
        "This project is relevant in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Creative Content Generation: Generating new cards requires the model to learn the patterns and linguistic structures present in existing card names and descriptions. This task showcases the potential of machine learning models in generating creative and unique content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Language Modeling: By training a language model on a specific domain, such as Yugioh card names, you can explore the nuances of the language used in that domain and generate text that adheres to those patterns and conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Gaming and Entertainment: The Yugioh trading card game has a vast collection of cards, and generating new card names can be a valuable resource for game developers, players, or card enthusiasts. The generated names can inspire new card designs or add variety to the existing card pool.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "When the idea was born I started to research a bit what others might have already accomplished with the same idea. Right when I started, my expectations were quiet high. After stumbling across [this](https://medium.com/@lukbebalduke/mtg-hivemind-artificial-intelligence-designing-magic-372530640cc1) article, I had to reset my expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating new Game Cards is not as trivial as it may seem. After all, a card game has specific game mechanics which are well thought-through. The different types, stats and features a single card brings to the game is always unique in some way. This fact alone makes it quiet hard to get consistent results with a machine learning model generating new cards. Seeing also how those Magic The Gathering Cards were generated using not one but multiple different AI's each with it's on purpose to finally generate a new Card made me rethink my approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of trying to generate a complete new card I limited my expectations to only generate new Card Names, Card Descriptions and potentially also an Image for the new card. I focused only on the creative aspect of the card generation without taking into consideration game mechanics, as this would've definetly increased the effort over the given time limit."
